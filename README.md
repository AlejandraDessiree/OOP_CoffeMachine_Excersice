## OOP Coffee Machine Exercise

This is a Python project that simulates a coffee machine using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP). It was created as part of my 100 Days of Python challenge, focusing on building a deeper understanding of classes and objects.

## Features

- Choose from drinks: espresso, latte, or cappuccino  
- Manages ingredients and resources (water, milk, coffee, money)  
- Checks if enough resources are available before making a drink  
- Allows users to insert coins and checks if payment is sufficient  
- Offers a report of remaining resources and earnings  
- Built entirely using Python classes and clean code structure

## What I Learned

- How to create and use classes and objects in Python  
- Working with class methods and attributes  
- Handling user input and conditional logic  
- Simulating real-world systems with code
